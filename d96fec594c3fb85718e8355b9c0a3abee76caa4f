      "message": "The requester-api is openbmc specific and this can be separated from the libpldm repo and make it as separate library(which will eventually make way for MCTP kernel sockets)\n\n1. Separate the generic part of libpldm(which can be used on any platform) with the openbmc specific. There has been confusions around this and this would bring clarity.\n2. In case we make proposals to contribute libpldm to DMTF, it will be ideal to not have any openbmc references in libpldm.",
