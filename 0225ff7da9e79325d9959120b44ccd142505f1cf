      "message": "I\u0027m having a bit of a hard time following this explanation. I think we need to workshop it to clarify what the problem is.\n\nLooking at the code it seems that `pldmtool` already uses the DBus `Requester` API. That much hasn\u0027t changed. You have moved that code to a separate method though.\n\nWas it the case that the `raw` command simply forgot to inject the already retrieved instance ID into the message metadata? If that\u0027s the case then we should say so directly. `libpldm` highlighting the issue with warning messages is different from `libpldm` being the root cause of the bug.",
