Don\u0027t we need a version bump?\n\nhttps://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html\n\nIt looks to me like both libpldm and libpldmresponder are just using the version of the overall pldm (meson) project.  That probably isn\u0027t what we want, because for example if you bump the project version to deal with this interface change, you\u0027ll also be bumping the version of libpldmresponder for no reason.",
