      "message": "I have updated the code so that, in places where functions with a void return type previously just returned (as in [Gerrit 80090] ), I now throw `pldm::InstanceIdError(instanceIdResult.error())` instead.\nThe reason I am not simply throwing `instanceIdResult.error()` is because the CI requires exceptions to be thrown as anonymous temporaries.\n\nFor non-void functions, the behavior remains the same as in [Gerrit 80090]: errors are handled by returning an error code (such as `PLDM_ERROR`) rather than throwing exceptions.\nThis avoids previous issues where an uncaught exception due to instance ID allocation failure could cause a pldmd core dump.\n\nFor the remaining areas in void functions where the thrown exception is not yet caught, I am considering introducing a function template to avoid code duplication while still allowing proper exception handling.\n\nShould these related changes be included in this patch, or submitted as a separate commit?\n\n[Gerrit 80090]: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/pldm/+/80090",
