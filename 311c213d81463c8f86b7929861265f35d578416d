      "message": "Hmm, this isn\u0027t going to work. phosphor-state-manager has a design point that it owns this property and it\u0027s solely based on the obmc-host-*.target systemd states. https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/bmc-reset-with-host-up.md has some design points but basically there\u0027s some fairly complicated systemd services and applications that run in phosphor-state-manager to ensure all systemd targets and services get into the right state in situations where the BMC is reset and the host is up. What phosphor-state-manager needs though is to know from PLDM if the host is running (i.e. all the other logic in this commit). I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s a way state-manager could monitor for this PDR to be received? Worst case could we create a PDI property to indicate checking, hostUp, hostDown?",
