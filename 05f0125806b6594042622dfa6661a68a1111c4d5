If not is this an IBM only thing ?",

(For example, containerID values could be assigned sequentially starting from 1, or 1000 if it necessary to have a value that is more readily distinguishable as a being a containerID.)\n    \n2) Create Entity Association PDRs for the physical-to-physical containment associations.\n\n3) Create the Sensor PDR, Effecter PDR, or other PDRs that are associated with the physical entities, and set the Entity Identification Information based on the containment PDRs that were created earlier.\n\n4) Create the PDRs for any logical entities and set the containerID value for the containing entity to the containerID for the appropriate physical container entities.\n\n5) Create the Sensor PDR, Effecter PDR, or other PDRs that reference those logical entities. \n\n\nWe are basically following the same.",
