      "message": "What do you think if we refactors the fw-update code and platform-mc code to reuse the terminus discovery flow and the methods which is already implemented in the `platform-mc` code. In that case, `platform-mc` can construct the fw-update handler for the terminus support T5 (fw-update).\n\nI saw that the patch set is adding `sendRecvPldmMsgOverMctp` which is already implementing in `terminus-manager.hpp/cpp`. In the next patch set we call `GetPLDMTypes` to check the supported type of one PLDM terminus.\n\nThis is not mandatory, but it will be great if we can completely refactor the pldm code of `platform-mc` and `fw-update`.",
