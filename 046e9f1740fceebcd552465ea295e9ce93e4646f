      "message": "+1 to what Deepak mentioned.\n\nThe PLDM specification already defines retries and timeouts at the command level. If those mechanisms aren’t sufficient to handle transient failures that you were mentioning, the issue likely needs to be addressed elsewhere. Introducing additional, ad-hoc retries within the PLDM layer itself can blur the separation of responsibilities and make behavior less deterministic \u0026 can mask deeper issues (like timing bugs, race conditions, or transport reliability problems).",

      "message": "Thank you all for explaining your considerations. In the past, I tried configuring retry and timeout options to avoid MCTP info initialization failures on our platform, and that approach was mostly effective. However, as more patches have been merged into the BMC over time, this issue has started to reappear.\n\nFrom a product stability perspective, I mainly want to ensure that critical features like monitoring PLDM sensors remain reliable. Re-adjusting retry options during validation takes considerable effort, and there\u0027s a risk the same issue could resurface again in the future—this is why I created this patch.\n\nThat said, I’d like to ask a question regarding request timeouts. On our platform, the BMC manages multiple hosts and a large number of sensors. In such an environment, is it possible that the current response queue handling in `pldmd` could lead to the following scenario:\n\n`pldmd` sends a request and starts the timeout timer.\nThe response is received and placed into the queue before the timeout expires.\nHowever, due to a large number of pending responses, `pldmd` fails to process this response in time, and the request is incorrectly marked as failed.\n\nI’d really appreciate your insights and suggestions on this.\nThank you again for the detailed explanations.",
