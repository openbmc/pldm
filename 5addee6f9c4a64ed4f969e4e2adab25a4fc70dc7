      "message": "@kamal can we have the commit message across this chain as something like below?  \n\nAdd support for the `coreCount` property in DBus\n\nThis commit introduces support for tracking the number of CPU cores during BMC power-on and persisting this information to a DBus property named `coreCount`. Upon BMC power-on, the system detects the number of CPU cores and updates the `coreCount` property accordingly. Additionally, the commit implements a persistence mechanism using the Cereal file write mechanism to store the `coreCount` value in a persistent file. Upon BMC restart, the system retrieves the `coreCount` value from the persistent file and restores it to the `coreCount` DBus property, ensuring consistency across system restarts.\n\nChanges:\n- Added `coreCount` property to DBus to store CPU core count information.\n- Implemented logic to detect and update `coreCount` property during BMC power-on.\n- Implemented persistence mechanism using Cereal file write to store `coreCount` value in a persistent file.\n- Implemented logic to restore `coreCount` value from the persistent file upon BMC restart.\n\nTested:",
