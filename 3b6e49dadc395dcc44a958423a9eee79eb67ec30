      "message": "Generally it isn\u0027t safe to pass references into co-routines because it is likely that the reference is invalidated before the co-routine even executes.  Are you sure this `\u0026rcOpt` is safe?  I guess it is being stored in a ... map?  So it is probably safe, unless there is a possibility of the `stopPolling` being called prior to the co-routine completing.",

      "message": "Yes, `std::map` should store entries at stable address as part of its balanced tree implementation, so I\u0027m pretty sure there is no problem.\n\n`stopPolling` also makes sure to cancel `scope` before destroy the map entry. Given how `pldmd` runs single-threaded, I think cancellation will always happen first.\n\n(Also, to destroy the map entry, according to `pair` layout, the map will need destroy the `scope` first, before destroying `rcOpt` and then destroying the entry. I have not check, but if `scope` RAII has already stopped the task, then `stopPolling` may not even need the `.request_stop()` part.)",
