      "message": "In compact numeric sensor, the `occurrenceRate` field doesn\u0027t mean update interval, it has the same mean as in numeric sensor\u0027s `unitRate` field which shouldn\u0027t be tied to the update time (this was verified by one of the DMTF members).\n\nThis is an issue because in this implementation sensors with `No Occurrence Rate` will not be updated at all.\n\nAnother issue is that the current pldm specs do not provide a way to determine the update time for compact numeric sensors.\n\nMaybe a better way to solve it is to provide a special compiler flag for compact numeric sensor update time?",
