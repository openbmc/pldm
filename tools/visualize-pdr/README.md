# Overview

The `pldmtool` for `GetPDR` command lacks to display all PDRs at once. It
fetches only one PDR at a time. With a lot of sensors/effecters & with a lot of
Host FRU pdrs coming in due to concurrent maintenance of the system,where the
fru's are added/ removed at runtime, it's really necessary to have a full system
view.

`pldm_visualise_pdrs.py` is a python script that can be used to fetch the PDR's
from the BMC and can parse them to display a full view of available PDR's on
system at any given point in time.

# Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- graphviz
  - Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is
    a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs
    and networks.
  - There are standard package availabe for graphviz for both rpm based as well
    as the debian based sytems, it can be installed using :

```bash
   RPM Distro : sudo dnf install graphviz
   Debian Distro : sudo apt install graphviz
   Mac Distro : brew install graphviz
```

- The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that the tool
  depend on, and that can be installed using:

```bash
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
              (or)
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```

# Usage

```ascii
usage: pldm_visualise_pdrs.py [-h] --bmc BMC --user USER --password PASSWORD [--port PORT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --bmc BMC            BMC IPAddress/BMC Hostname
