      "message": "We have encountered unexpected issues with coroutines while using pldmd. Specifically, pldmd may crash at sdbusplus/async/stdexec/any_sender_of.hpp where __object_pointer is null.\n\nIt appears that there are still concerns regarding the implementation. Is there a plan to do the sensor monitor implementation in the near future?\n\nThanks!",
