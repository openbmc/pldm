As we are not blocking anything ..but this is merely a way to detect/log an error condition that we tried setting a host effecter but that failed because host is not in the right state to be able to respond to it.\n\n@tom - i see you have added this code,  do you remember why this check was added for effecters ? I am thinking we remove this entire try-catch block here, but enhance the trace at line number 217 to print the effecter id \u0026 statefeild, and other additional dbus details.",
