The value reflects the most recently assessed state that caused an event to be generated. The eventState can be different than either the presentState or the previousState.\n\nAs per the spec, the eventstate seems to map to the state value from the state set that is associated with the sensor right ? not just EVENTS_ENABLED or EVENTS_DISABLED right ?",
