      "message": "@andrew\nas per previous comment i was trying to segregate code in 3 review but problem is review 2 and review 3 has function signature change which will compile time error and review 2 \u0026 3 does not have much difference, so i segregate whole code in 2 review.\nreview 1: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/pldm/+/66754/2\nreview 2: current review (https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/pldm/+/63950)\nthe above design is tightly coupled with virtual classes and change in base class reflect all child class that\u0027s why mainly it\u0027s appear as massive change.\nthere are 4 files(file_io.h, file_io.cpp, file_io_by_type.hpp, file_io_by_type.cpp) which has major change and cannot be segregated.",
