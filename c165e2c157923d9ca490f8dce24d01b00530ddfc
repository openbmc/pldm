Do we see more pldm knowing apps in the future..etc. A good topic for community discussion and not to hold this patch.\n\n2.\n\u003ethe soft off application would not start any timer \u0026 would wait for the host to gracefullyshutdown.\n\nWhat will be the behavior if host never sees the power off request and the graceful shutdown RF API never completes?\nI am thinking we need to articulate the flow better, in the context of error paths.",
