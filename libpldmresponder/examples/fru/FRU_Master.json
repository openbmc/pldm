# This is the master config file for generating PLDM FRU records from the D-Bus
# inventory objects. "service" is the name of D-Bus service hosting the
# inventory D-Bus objects, "root_path" is the root path for all the inventory
# D-Bus objects and "interfaces" section specifies the type of FRU's for which,
# FRU records will be created in the FRU table. In this example, PLDM FRU
# records will be created for all FRU's of type Board and CPU. For each FRU
# type, corresponding config JSON's are needed for each record. In the example
# directory, Board_General.json is the config to generate the General FRU record
# for FRU of type Board and Board_VINI.json is the config to generate the OEM
# record (VINI is a record in IBM IPZ VPD format) for FRU of type Board. For all
# instances of the same FRU, the same config JSON will apply.
