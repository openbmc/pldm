If that function can\u0027t handle an empty list, it should be fixed, otherwise you\u0027re letting abstractions leak everywhere for the callers.\n\nThe `handleMctpEndpoints` uses the `existingMctpInfos` as input parameter, it will go thru the element in `existingMctpInfos` list. There is no reason to call that function when the list is empty, I think.\nAnyway, I will set the patch set WIP while working with Manoj in IBM\u0027s issue.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e 2.
