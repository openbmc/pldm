      "message": "This is not obvious why this is necessary or solves anything.\n\n1. Why would we need to put this logic around every call to `handleMctpEndpoints`?  If that function can\u0027t handle an empty list, it should be fixed, otherwise you\u0027re letting abstractions leak everywhere for the callers.\n\n2. That function just does an iteration over the input parameter; nothing about it should be failing if the list is empty.",
