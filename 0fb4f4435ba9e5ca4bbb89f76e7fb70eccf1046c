      "message": "Here we are doing a reinterpret cast, which means you\u0027re treating the memory address of supportedTypes as a pointer to a bitfield8_t object. This is low-level type-punning, essentially reinterpreting the memory layout of supportedTypes to treat it as a different type.\nbut \nPlacement new is used to construct an object in an already-allocated memory location. It does not allocate memory, but rather constructs an object at a specified location.\n\nWe could convert this to use placement new, but I think its better to use a cast here.",
