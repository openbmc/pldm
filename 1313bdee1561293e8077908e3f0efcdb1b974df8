Seems less error prone if we write the side file and set the bios attribute from the same places, in that way we ensure that if we need to change the side being set we update both the file and the bios attribute.\nFrom the processRename() function we can have \"setBootSideBiosAttr(pldmBootSideData.current_boot_side);\" like you did above.",
