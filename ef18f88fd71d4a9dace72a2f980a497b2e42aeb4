      "message": "This seems like an un-necessary \u0026 additional dbus hop , and i am not sure if PLDM doing a dbus call on PLDM hosted interfaces would ever work ? as far as i understand this should hit an ELOOP \u0026 the dbus call should fail.\n\nhttps://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/src/libsystemd/sd-bus/sd-bus.c#L2429\n\nCan we directly parse the PDR\u0027s and get the effector id , if this dbus object would have been done in a different daemon, then using the dbus call would have been fine , but given that PLDM itself is now creating the lamp test interface, PLDM calling its own interface to get the effecter ID is not correct.",
