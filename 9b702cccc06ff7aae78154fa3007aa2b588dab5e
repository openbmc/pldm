      "message": "The \"get PLDM command failed\" issue occurs during a request timeout.\nCould it be that with an overload of requests, the PLDM device responds within the timeout, but PLDM cannot process it in time, marking the request as failed?\n\nWhen a get PLDM command fails, it results in an incorrect initialization of the PLDM device, and if the failed command is for PDR, this can cause the PLDM device to disappear with no further chance for sensor polling.\nShould the request timeout duration be extended in this case?\n\nYour advice would be appreciated.

Or increate the time out or retry time. To give the terminus a change to get the bus and response for the request from BMC.\n\n\u003e Failed to Get PLDM Commands for terminus 40, error 4\n\u003e \n\u003e If this step fails, it might cause the getPDRs process to assume the get PDR command is unsupported, leading to the PLDM device not initializing properly.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e Moreover, if the `processRxMsg handles incoming requests and responses` then I can\u0027t handle the `pldmd` communication when `pldmd` in handling sensor polling for all of 16 devices.\n\u003e \n\u003e Could you explain if there is a way to configure or achieve binding devices one by one instead of binding all at once? Is your point that, in our environment, the initialization of so many PLDM devices could indeed overwhelm the PLDM response handling? \n\nYes. You can call MCTP binding one by one, the next devices will be bind when the previous devices is done by checking the existing of terminus sensors.\nYou only need this when the terminus in the same I2C bus.\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/openbmc/+/75302/6/meta-ampere/meta-mitchell/recipes-ampere/host/ampere-mctp-i2c-binding/ampere_mctp_i2c_binding.sh#95\nThis is the way Ampere binding the terminus in the same bus one by one.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e Failure in `getting PLDM commands supports` of one PLDM type does not mean the device not good to unmap it and rediscovery it.\n\u003e \n\u003e I’m also not clear on whether this means the device should not be unmapped even if it fails. My goal is to ensure that if a timeout occurs during the initialization phase, the PLDM device still has a chance to retry initialization.\n\nMy idea when only prints the error in `GetPLDMCommands` of one terminus is\n1. If the devices is ready for `GetPLDMTypes` commands that means it is ready for pldm requests. There is no reason to failed for next commands in the discovery phase. If there is failure then there are some things wrong with the OEM systems. In that case, print errors to allow the developer debug.\n\n2. The terminus can support many PLDM types, Base (0x0), Platform and control (0x2), FRU, BIOS. Failure in `GetPLDMCommands` of BIOS or FRU type does not mean the terminus is not functional and can\u0027t response its status. So print the error is enough.\n\nYou can bring your idea to the `pmci` discord group to discuss about your patch set. If the community agree with your proposal then we will merge it.\n\nMy idea is simple `If the devices if failed for PLDM commands in the discovery phase. Then there is some things wrong with the system. Print error to debug instead of continuous retrying to discovery`\n\nBecause if the system can\u0027t response for some basis PLDM commands in the discovery phase, then in will fault when start polling the many of PLDM sensor/status/effecter or handle events because there will be more PLDM request from BMC at this phase.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Thank you very much for your advice.",
