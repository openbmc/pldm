      "message": "As my understanding the purpose of this patches is support static EID table.\nThe mctp_endpoint_discovery is a dynamic mechanism to add/remove the PLDM devices base on the MCTP devices in the MCTP D-Bus interface. It is not reasonable to add static EID solution in mctp_endpoint_discovery. fw-update/manager is concern fw-update so we should not change it also.\n\nWhat do you think if we add device manager interface which is similar as manager of fw-update interface? This interface will manager all of EID in MCTP D-Bus interface and also static EID if need. You can load static_eid_table.json when construct Device manager interface.\n\nI created patches to support device manager interface and device handler in below patches:\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/pldm/+/51246\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/pldm/+/51245",
