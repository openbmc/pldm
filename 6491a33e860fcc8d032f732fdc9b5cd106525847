      "message": "On reflection, I think this should be `PLDM_REQUESTER_SUCCESS` anyway if we ignore the other aspects for now? Adjusting my score back to 0 for this to be answered.\n\nI dislike this retries patch because it doesn\u0027t provide proper retry semantics, it\u0027s papering over the fact that libpldm lacks them. Perhaps another tack to take is to make people who want this behaviour retry in a shell loop using the process exit code? Maybe that nudges people towards helping clean up libpldm?\n\nI gave it a +1 because I don\u0027t personally want to get in the way of it, but if you have objections also please score it appropriately ðŸ˜Š",
