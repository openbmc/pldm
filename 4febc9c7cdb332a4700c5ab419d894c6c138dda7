If we need more readable logs, please feel free to add fw_update spec support to pldm dissector in Wireshark.\n\nIBM took a lot of effort in getting the base \u0026 platform spec supported in pldm wireshark dissecter. Dont want the code base to be polluted with these logs in yet another verbose option.",
