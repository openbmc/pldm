      "message": "The bulk of PLDM T5 traffic is the Tx/Rx of RequestFirmwareData where PLDM FD downloads image from the BMC. With the number of PLDM devices we support on a platform, the total amount of data we transfer exceeds 140+ M, capturing MCTP traffic for this and adding it to BMC dump is not a feasible solution. \n\nSo printing Tx/Rx for the RequestFirmwareData without the actual data firmware data, gives decent debug capabilities on the BMC when PLDM firmware update is in progress and helped us triage issues where logs on the device has been insufficient.\n\nI agree with Manoj\u0027s concern in principle, there are platform specific needs where such flexibility is needed. Also unlike a feature flag where more forethought is needed, flag for debug tracing has minimal side effects.",

It even has capabilities to split packet captures into multiple parts before it can be dissected using standard tools like `editcap`.\n\n\n\u003e capturing MCTP traffic for this and adding it to BMC dump is not a feasible solution.\n\nIf this needs to be captured as part of the BMC dump, can we not just add them as `INFO` messages written into the journal, rather than a new verbose option which under the cover puts things into the journal ? I still think we are complicating this more than it needs to be by putting this behind yet another verbose option.",
